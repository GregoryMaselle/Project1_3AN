# Advanced Numerical Methods (3rd year Course) Project 1

This Matlab code is used to calculate and display simulations for solutions to the problem described in proj1_3an_23.pdf

## Installation
You will need to install Matlab to run this code (to my knowledge.) You can acquire a matlab license and subsequent software at https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html.

## Some Outputs for varying initial conditions.

## Usage

Once Matlab is installed, you can simply open the project and run it as is.

## Results

This code along with an analysis of this code (available on request) earned me a mark of 95%.
